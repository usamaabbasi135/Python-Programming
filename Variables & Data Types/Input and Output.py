# Write a program to take a user's name as input and greet them with their name.

user_name = input("Enter you name: ")
print("Welcome",user_name)

# Create a program that asks for the user's birth year and calculates their age.

current_year = 2024
user_entered_year = input("Enter your birth year: ")
user_entered_year = int(user_entered_year)

ageUser = current_year - user_entered_year
print("Your age is: ", ageUser)


# How can you take two inputs from the user in a single line? Write code to demonstrate this.
